# steganography
Hiding information inside image

LSB METHOD

It uses the least significant bits of the image pixels to store information i.e. LSB are overwritten. Change in LSB doesnt reflect i.e. human eye cannot detect the variation from actual data to embeded data. Say 2 LSB are overwritten so the maximum change will be 4.
